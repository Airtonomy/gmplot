\:wave: Welcome to the API reference for gmplot!

While most functionality should be available as-is, some features require a
`Google Maps API key <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key>`_.

**Note:** This documentation is based on the latest commit, as such, some features might not apply if you're on v1.2.0 or earlier.
